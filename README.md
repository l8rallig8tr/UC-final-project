### Project Name
Maze Game

# Idea
The idea of my project is to create a game similar to pacman where the player has to go through a maze and collect 8 cherries to unlock the door, as soon as the door is unlocked, the player can reach the prize. There is a start menu which allows the player to start the game, and if the player collides with the enemy, another screen pops up to restart the game, furthermore if the player wins, the game restarts to the main start screen.


# Future Work 
For my future work, i will update the main and exit sceen for it to become more advanced, moreover i will add more levels where the game can be harder each time the player wins.
